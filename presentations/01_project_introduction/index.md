## Project background

* We are medical researchers interested in the risk factors of **Drug Induced Liver Injury** (DILI)
* DILI arises from a reaction to drugs to treat Tuberculosis (TB)
* The data we will use are hospital records taken from a London TB center. 
* The data was hosted on Bristol University's **Research Data Repository**
